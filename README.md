# Deep Learning (DL) methods using T1-MRI Imaging to predict Alzheimerâ€™s Disease

This repo contains all files and documentation related to the final project portion of the BIOS 740 course at UNC-CH. Unfortunately due to time constraints, it was only possible to spend only around a mere 3-4 days to complete this project. This is the reason as to why some important areas may seem incomplete in the analysis (as laid out in the report).
